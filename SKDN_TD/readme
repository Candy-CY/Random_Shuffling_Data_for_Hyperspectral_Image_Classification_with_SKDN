All experiments were performed using three patch-data-based CNN methods in HSI classification, 
which are DPRN, SSTFF and MRViT.
The paper name of the method DPRN:
Deep Pyramidal Residual Networks for Spectral-Spatial Hyperspectral Image Classification.

The paper name of the method SSTFF:
Spectral-Spatial Feature Tokenization Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification.
(Project Repository address: https://github.com/zgr6010/HSI_SSFTT)
The paper name of the method MRViT:
Mixed Residual Convolutions with Vision Transformer in Hyperspectral Image Classification.
